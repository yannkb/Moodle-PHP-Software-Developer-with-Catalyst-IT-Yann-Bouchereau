# Moodle-PHP-Software-Developer-with-Catalyst-IT-Yann-Bouchereau

This repository is a programming evaluation for a Moodle / PHP Software Developer with Catalyst IT

I will be using Docker for my application to have the same environment as the one used during the tests.

## Docker commands
1. Run `docker compose build --no-cache` to build fresh images
2. Run `docker compose up --pull always -d --wait` to start the project
3. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers
